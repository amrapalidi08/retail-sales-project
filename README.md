# **Retail Sales Dashboard — Project 01**

This project analyzes a small retail sales dataset to answer three core business questions:

1. **Which product categories generate the highest sales?**
2. **Which regions have the highest order quantities?**
3. **Which products are the top performers by revenue?**

I built a Tableau dashboard to visualize these insights, performing basic data cleaning, creating calculated fields, building visualizations, and assembling a complete dashboard.
