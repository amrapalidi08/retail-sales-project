Retail Sales Dashboard — Project 01
This project analyzes a small retail sales dataset to answer three core business questions:
Which product categories generate the highest sales?
Which regions have the highest order quantities?
Which products are the top performers by revenue?
I built a Tableau dashboard to visualize these insights, performing basic data cleaning, creating calculated fields, building visualizations, and assembling a complete dashboard.

his dashboard serves as my first published data analytics project, showcasing my ability to:
Work with datasets
Clean and prepare data
Build Tableau dashboards
Use Git, VS Code, and GitHub
Create and publish a professional portfolio project
This project marks the start of a series of data analytics and visualization work that I will continue to publish as I build my portfolio.
